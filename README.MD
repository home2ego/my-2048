## 🎯 Aim

Merge numbered tiles by sliding them to create a tile with the number **2048** (or keep playing to beat your high score!).

## 🕹️ How to Play

- **Controls**: Use **arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →)** or **swipes on touch devices** to move tiles. Press **R** to restart.
- **Merge**: Tiles with the same number combine into one when they collide (e.g., `2 + 2 = 4`).
- **New Tiles**: After every move, a new tile `2` spawns in a random empty spot.
- **Game Over**: No more moves? The grid is full, and the game ends!
- **Win**: Merge equal numbers to reach 2048.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **SCSS**
- **TypeScript**
